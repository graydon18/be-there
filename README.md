# Be There
Be There is an volunteer scheduling app focused on minimizing food waste on university campuses across the country. Each week, you can sign up for volunteer roles to transport excess food from campus dining halls to nearby food insecurity organizations. By providing a flexible sign up system that allows for the ever-changing availability of university studens, we ensure that there will be people to Be There for the job!
